# QUEUE MACHINE
This project is created strictly for passing ***"Software Development Tools"*** classes in studies

## USES
It is to be used in environments in which queues are becoming unbearable and chaotic.
Original project is created for dean's offices in universities, but with small changes can be applied for city councils and others.

## Planned functions
1. Connection to database
2. Option for students to add themselves to appropriate queue
3. Option for dean's office workers to "mark students as done" and remove from queue
4. Option to narrow down specific problem-category that student comes with.

### Language
This project is C++ based.

### CI
TeamCity by Jetbrains is used for CI in this project.

In case we need further testing we will configure basic automated unit testing CI
